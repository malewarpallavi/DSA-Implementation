# DSA Implementation Repository

**Author:** Pallavi Omprakash Malewar  
**Course:** Logic Building Programming Class  
**Batch:** Marvellous Infosystems Batch [Your Batch Name / Year]

This repository contains my implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** as part of the **Logic Building Programming Class at Marvellous Infosystems**.  
The goal is to strengthen logical thinking, understand fundamental data structures, and improve programming and problem-solving skills through hands-on practice.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Recursion
- Basic Problem Solving

More concepts and programs will be added as I continue learning in my Logic Building and DSA journey.
